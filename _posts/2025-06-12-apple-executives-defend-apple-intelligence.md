Joanna Stern sat down and interviewed Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak.

> A year after last year’s conference, major Siri features are still missing. The company’s head of software and head of marketing say why they aren’t worried.

Apples message on where they are at and their strategy for AI is very clear in this interview.  They're adding AI to existing apps and services to enhance them, real time translations are a good example of this, and Siri is going to take longer than they had expected but they're not in a rush.

I think this is a perfectly reasonable approach and wouldn't be that remarkable if they hadn't rushed to announce products that weren't ready at last years WWDC.
