Molly White writing on her blog Citation Needed:

> The relative separation between World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin projects, both of which are trying to develop defi trading platforms, may help to explain the chaos around the latter’s wallet launch announcement yesterday.

There was an announcement by Magic Eden that they were launching a Trump Wallet and then a complete denial from Eric Trump that he knew anything about the project.  He does know about another project that is launching a Trump Wallet and trading platform though.  The whole thing is about as big of a mess as you could imagine a Trump + Crypto + Crypto Wallet + Trading product could be (and that's a pretty considerable mess).

Again from Molly White:

> It is very plausible to me that Trump has sold his likeness to so many separate projects, not to mention his sons also using the “Trump” branding, that no one really knows what’s going on in aggregate.

I 100% agree that this, unfortunately, makes complete sense.  If it's not gross enough that the Trump family is launching meme coins, it's even grosser that they are just licensing their likeness, to any grifter that can pay for it.
