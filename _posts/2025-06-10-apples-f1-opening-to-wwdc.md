title: Apples F1 opening to WWDC
---
Apple opened their WWDC keynote yesterday with Senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi racing an F1 car around the roof of the Apple campus.  Ignoring the fact that F1 cars don't race on oval tracks, but IndyCar's do, it all felt a bit uncomfortable.

Apple have recently been battling with developers in court over their 30% app store commission.  An American court just ruled that Apple wilfully ignored a previous court order and insisted that they must allow developers to link out of their apps to alternate payment methods on the web. 

Meanwhile the opening to the developer conference is an elaborate video production that must have cost quite a lot of money.  It all felt a little bit tone deaf.

It ended with Tim Cook celebrating Apple for taking out the top spot for the best quality programming for the fourth year in a row and was all in service of promoting the upcoming F1 film.  Since the rest of the keynote was software announcements it did make sense to put it up front.

Snark aside I do enjoy the quality of Apple TV+ productions.  Even if I end up not enjoying a show or film it's never because the production is bad.
