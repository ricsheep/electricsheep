# About this site

This site is made using the wonderful [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator. The only external library used is [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the lightning bolt, hamburger menu, github and potentially other icons.

The code is open source and licensed under the MIT license. You can find it here on <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [GitHub](https://github.com/ricsheep/electricsheep)

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for writing Markdown and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for editing code.

ElectricSheep is hosted by <i class="fa-brands fa-digital-ocean"></i> [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and the domain is registered with [porkbun](https://porkbun.com).
